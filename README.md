Project Title*:
Yoga Abyas

Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
Yoga is a both physical and mental exercise which helps to relieve our stress. It helps to keep our body fit and flexible. Yoga helps us to cure breathing problems. There are different types of asanas in yoga. Meditation is the key for yoga. Through yoga we can control all the senses in the body. We can be able to lead a healthy life through 1 hour of yoga daily.

Project Description*:
Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke) and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the mind (Chitta) and mundane suffering (Du?kha). In the yogic culture, Shiva is not known as a god, but as the Adiyogi or the first yogi â€“ the originator of yoga. He was the one who first put this seed into the human mind. According to the yogic lore, over fifteen thousand years ago, Shiva attained to his full enlightenment and abandoned himself in an intense ecstatic dance upon the Himalayas. When his ecstasy allowed him some movement, he danced wildly. When it became beyond movement, he became utterly still. These are the only four realities in your life: body, mind, emotion, and energy. Whatever you wish to do with yourself, it must be on these four levels.
